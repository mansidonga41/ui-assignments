# E-Commerce React Application

This is an e-commerce React application that allows users to browse and purchase products from a wide range of options. The application has been integrated with an API to fetch all the available products. Users can search for products, add them to their shopping cart, increment or decrement the quantity of each product, and view detailed information about each product. The application provides an order summary page where users can review all the items in their cart, view the total cost, and proceed to the payment process. For now the payment process is not integrated, instead a message has been displayed that user's payment has been successfully done.
